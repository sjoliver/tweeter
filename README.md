# Tweeter Project

## Welcome to Tweeter!
Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter-like app. Users can create new "tweets", which must be less than 140 characters, which are then posted to the tweet feed. 

Each tweet post contains a randomly-generated avatar, user name, and user handle. It will also display how long ago the tweet was posted.
